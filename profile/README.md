### üçø Fun facts
- Knowing that the egg came before the chicken is no longer something to be too proud of since at least [1859](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species).
- If `\mathbb{X}` is enough to rebrand a multi-billion-dolar company, `\mathbb{M}^3` is good enough for a lab logo.
